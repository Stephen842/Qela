MUTATIONS - WRITE OPERATION

Create Post
mutation CreatePost1 {
  createPost(
    content: "Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology that allows digital information to be recorded and shared across a network of computers in a secure and immutable way. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain ensures that no single entity can control or alter the data once it is added to the chain. Key concepts include blocks, cryptographic hashes, and consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake. Blockchain underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum and is now applied to supply chain, healthcare, and digital identity systems."

Machine learning allows systems to learn from data, while deep learning simulates neural networks. Ethical concerns such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and job displacement must be addressed. The future will include collaborative human-AI systems, autonomous vehicles, and AI-driven scientific discoveries."
